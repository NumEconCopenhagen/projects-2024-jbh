# Fat pockets or mouth full? 

In this project, I build a simple two-period consumption-saving model with constant relative risk aversion to illustrate the dynamics of intertemporal optimization. I then expand the model to include second-period income and investigate this with both no income risk and stochastic income risk. Lastly, I extend the model to include preference heterogeneity to illustrate how this alters the allocation of consumption over time.

The **results** of the project can be seen from running [modelproject.ipynb](modelproject.ipynb).

**Dependencies:** Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
