# Exam project

In this project, I solve economic problems involving numerical optimization and code the Barycentric Interpolation algorithm.

The results of the project can be seen from running [exam_2024.ipynb](exam_2024.ipynb). 


## Dependencies:

Apart from a standard Anaconda Python 3 installation, the project requires no further packages.
